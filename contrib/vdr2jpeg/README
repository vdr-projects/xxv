This is a simple c++ program to grab jpeg images from VDR-Recordings. 
It's based on vdrsync.pl and ffmain, and was design as little study to enhance xxv.
vdr2jpeg are used from xxv to generated preview images of recordings.

Requirements
-------------
ffmpeg-svn (tested with r14788)

Recommended
------------
ffmpeg as shared libary and with software scaler

$ cd ffmpeg && \
 ./configure --enable-shared --enable-swscale && \
  make && \
  make install

Installation
------------

to build, type simple
$ make all

for install on /usr/bin/local :
$ make install

or build with more diagnostic
$ make all DEBUG=1 

or to link vdr2jpeg static, 
if your want that no external libraries are needed at run-time
$ make all STATIC=1 

 
Usage 
----------
$ ./vdr2jpeg
Usage: ./vdr2jpeg
            -r recordings    : VDR recording folder
            -f frame         : wanted frame (resolution at PAL - 1/25s)
            -o outdirectory  : output folder
            -x 160           : scaled width of output image
            -y 120           : scaled height of output image
            -s 5000          : frame range, started at wanted frame (e.g 500 : 20s)
            -i 25            : space beetween frames at selected range (resolution at PAL - 1/25s)
            -c 5             : number of extracted frames of an recording or within the selected range 


e.g. to extract frames 5000,10000,15000 (at 3,6,9 Minutes)

$ vdr2jpeg -r /video/Auf_der_Flucht/2004-12-28.22:10.50.99.rec \
	-f 5000 -f 10000 -f 15000


same using with selected span of frames

$ vdr2jpeg -r /video/Auf_der_Flucht/2004-12-28.22:10.50.99.rec \
	-f 5000 -s 10000 -i 5000
